# Welcome
Welcome to `Introduction to NumPy`. This is a short sequence of notes on NumPy for scientific work, specially in the field of data science written by [Jubayer Hossian](https://jhossain.me/).

This site is available online at [github](https://hossainlab.github.io/numpy/)


```{note}
These notes were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
